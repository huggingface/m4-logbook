m4 experiments logbook

Besides the usual experiment entries at https://github.com/huggingface/m4/ this repo is for detailed logs with reproduction steps and potentially multiple log files, core dumps, graphs, etc. We use it to keep the m4 repo small and not bloated with transient data.

But since there are multiple instructions on how debug and analysis of problems was done these logs can be invaluable to some people.
